## What's a browser?

Before we know how a browser works, let's describe a browser. It can be described as a **software application** that retreives data from a server and presents or 
renders a page  from the world wide web. The world wide web is a resource of documents that can be accessed via the internet. The documents' location is specified
by the URL(Uniform Resource Locator).

## The browser's main function
The core function of a browser is to present the web resources by requesting a server and displaying it in the browser window. The resources are mainly HTML documents.
They can also be videos , images or any other content. As stated under "What's a browser" topic, the resources are specified by a user using a URL/URI.
Examples of browsers include:
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Edge
* Safari

The browsers have common user interface like the:
* Address bar for typing the URL
* Menu icon 
* Home, refresh, forward and backward buttons

There are many more similarities.

### So let's get deeper into understanding the browser and its structure.
